          the United Arab Emirates
          shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute which may arise in connection with these Legal Terms.
        </p>
        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
        <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal
          Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party"
          and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to fi rst att empt to negotiate any Dispute (except
          those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least __________ days before initiating
          arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon writt en notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
        <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <p>Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms, including any question regarding its
          existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and fi nally resolved by the International
          Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146)
          according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this
          clause. The number of arbitrators shall be __________. The seat, or legal place, or arbitration shall be
          __________. The language of the proceedings shall be __________. The governing law of these Legal Terms shall
          be substantive law of __________.</p>
        <h3>Restrictions</h3>
        <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To
          the full extent permitt ed by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is
          no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
          procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
          capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
        <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>
        <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal
          negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity
          of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
          allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive
          relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
          any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
          Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above,
          and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
