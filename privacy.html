        <h2>DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
        <p>In Short:
          We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when

          Services, prevent crashes, fi x bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
        <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for
          analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to
          your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences).
          The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and
          services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
        <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in
          our Cookie Notice.</p>
        <h2>HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
        <p>In Short:
          If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to

          " above), in and other countries.</p>
        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these
          countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in
          your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance
          with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
        <h2>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>In Short:
          We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfi ll the purposes outlined in this privacy notice

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete

        <h2>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

          withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "

        <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from

          problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
          requirements.</p>
        <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
          feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
          browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been fi nalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
          any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
          revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
        <h2>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p>In Short:
          Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
        <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
          "Revised" date at the top of this privacy notice. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may
          notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notifi cation.
          We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
          information.</p>
        <h2>HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p>If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may contact us by post at:</p>
        <h1>HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</h1>
        <p>Based on the applicable laws of your country, you may have the right to request access to the personal
          information we collect from you, details about how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, or delete your
          personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal
